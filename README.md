# Teise - A personal portfolio projectâ˜•
The live version of this site can be found [here](https://teise.vercel.app/).
## Why teise?
Teise is inspired by a real local coffee shop and the idea ~~came to me in a dream~~ came to me while eating there... 
Teise is partly a play on words, selling cups of tea, but also because the coffee shop sits on the bank of the River Teise.
## How is teise built?
To create this project I used:

 - Nextjs
 - Strapi (for the blog posts)
 - Tailwindcss
 
To host the frontend I used vercel and the backend (Strapi CMS) is hosted on heroku.
